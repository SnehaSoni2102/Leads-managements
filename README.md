# LeadsMangements

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.
##
To set up an Angular project, you'll need to follow a series of commands. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:
##
## 1. Installed Node.js and npm

Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Check if they're installed using:
##
node -v
##
npm -v
##

## 2. Installed Angular CLI

The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool to initialize, develop, and maintain Angular applications.
##
npm install -g @angular/cli
##
## Created a New Angular Project

ng new leads-management
##

## 4. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd leads-management
##

## 5. Serve the Application

ng serve
##
Login component added
##  
- command to add Login Component
##
   -- ng generate component login 
## 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
